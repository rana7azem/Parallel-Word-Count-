## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a **Word Count** application using:
- A **sequential (serial)** version.
- A **parallel** version based on **OpenMP**.

The program reads a large text file, tokenizes all words (case-insensitive), counts their occurrences, and prints the top frequent words.

---

## 🧩 Implementation Details

### 🧱 Sequential Version (`src/wc_serial.cpp`)
- Reads the file line by line.
- Splits words on non-alphanumeric characters.
- Converts all characters to lowercase.
- Uses `unordered_map<string, long long>` to store word frequencies.
- Prints results alphabetically.

### ⚙️ Parallel Version (`src/wc_parallel.cpp`)
- Uses **OpenMP** for multithreading.
- Each thread builds a **local map** to avoid race conditions.
- After processing, all local maps are **merged serially** into a global map.
- Parallel section:
  ```cpp
  #pragma omp parallel
  {
      int tid = omp_get_thread_num();
      auto &mp = local_maps[tid];
      #pragma omp for schedule(static)
      for (...) { /* tokenize & count */ }
  }


  🧮 Correctness Check

To verify correctness between serial and parallel versions:

./wc_serial.exe data/big.txt | sort > out_serial.txt
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./wc_parallel.exe data/big.txt 100000 | sort > out_parallel.txt
diff out_serial.txt out_parallel.txt


✅ If no output, both versions match perfectly.

🧠 Avoiding Race Conditions

Each thread maintains its own unordered_map → No shared writes.

Final merging happens after all threads finish.

Safer and faster than using #pragma omp critical on shared map.

Efficiency vs Threads	
📊 Analysis Summary
🧩 Observations

Speedup improves as threads increase, but efficiency decreases gradually.

At 8 threads → ~4× speedup (≈ 50% efficiency).

Caused by:

File I/O being serial.

Merge phase overhead.

Thread synchronization and cache effects.

⚖️ Amdahl’s Law

Even if 90% of a program is parallelized, the remaining serial part limits total speedup.

This matches the observed results — scaling is sub-linear due to the serial fraction and OpenMP overhead.
